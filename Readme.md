# Magical Arena Project

## Overview

The Magical Arena project simulates a magical battle arena where two players fight until one dies. Each player has attributes for health, strength, and attack, and they take turns attacking and defending until one player's health reaches zero.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **Design_implementation**: Contains the detailed design and implementation of the project.
- **prototype**: Contains the initial prototype.

### Design_implementation

This directory contains the final design and implementation of the Magical Arena project. It includes the source code, unit tests, and instructions for running the application.

#### Contents

- **`src/`**:
  - `player.js`: Defines the `Player` class.
  - `arena.js`: Defines the `Arena` class where the match logic is implemented.
  - `index.js`: Entry point to run the game simulation.
- **`tests/`**:
  - `player.test.js`: Unit tests for the `Player` class.
  - `arena.test.js`: Unit tests for the `Arena` class.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the Design_implementation directory**:

   ```sh
   cd Design_implementation
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the game simulation**:
   ```sh
   node src/index.js
   ```

### Running Tests

1. **Navigate to the Design_implementation directory**:

   ```sh
   cd Design_implementation
   ```

2. **Run the unit tests**:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
